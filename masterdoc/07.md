# Lakehouse end-to-end scenario

Traditionally, organizations have been building modern data warehouses for their transactional and structured data analytics needs. And data lakehouses for big data (semi/unstructured) data analytics needs. These two systems ran in parallel, creating silos, data duplication, and increased total cost of ownership.

Microsoft Fabric is an all-in-one analytics solution for enterprises that covers everything from data movement to data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence. It offers a comprehensive suite of services, including data lake, data engineering, and data integration, all in one place. Fabric with its unification of data store and standardization on Delta Lake format allows you to eliminate silos, remove data duplication, and drastically reduce the total cost of ownership.

With the flexibility offered by Fabric, you can implement either lakehouse or data warehouse architectures or combine them together to get the best of both with simple implementation. In this tutorial, you're going to take an example of a retail organization and build its lakehouse from start to finish. It uses the medallion architecture where the bronze layer has the raw data, the silver layer has the validated and deduplicated data, and the gold layer has highly refined data. You can take the same approach to implement a lakehouse for any organization from any industry.

## Architecture

   ![Lakehouse end-to-end architecture](../media/07/01.png)

The above image shows the lakehouse end-to-end architecture. The components involved are described in the following list:

- **Data sources:** Fabric makes it quick and easy to connect to Azure Data Services, as well as other cloud-based platforms and on-premises data sources, for streamlined data ingestion.
- **Ingestion:** You can quickly build insights for your organization using more than 200 native connectors. These connectors are integrated into the Fabric pipeline and utilize the user-friendly drag-and-drop data transformation with dataflow. Additionally, with the Shortcut feature in Fabric, you can connect to existing data, without having to copy or move it.
- **Transform and store:** Fabric standardizes on Delta Lake format. This means all the Fabric engines can access and manipulate the same dataset stored in OneLake without duplicating data. This storage system provides the flexibility to build lakehouses using a medallion architecture or a data mesh, depending on your organizational requirements. You can choose between a low-code or no-code experience for data transformation, utilizing either pipelines/dataflows or notebook/Spark for a code-first experience.
- **Consume:** Power BI can consume data from the Lakehouse for reporting and visualization. Each Lakehouse has a built-in TDS/SQL endpoint, for easy connectivity and querying of data in the Lakehouse tables from other reporting tools. Additionally, when a Lakehouse is created, a corresponding secondary item called a Warehouse is automatically generated with the same name as the Lakehouse. It provides users with the TDS/SQL endpoint functionality.

## Data and transformation flow

This lab uses **Wide World Importers (WWI) sample data** to build this end-to-end lakehouse lakehouse. In this implementation, the sample data is stored in an Azure Data storage account in Parquet file format for all the tables. However, in real-world scenarios, data would typically originate from various sources and in diverse formats.

The following image shows the source, destination and data transformation:

![data-transformation-flow](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/MIDP-Lab-With-Microsoft-Fabric/blob/dev/media/07/02.png?raw=true)

- **Data source:** The source data is in Parquet file format and in an unpartitioned structure. It's stored in a folder for each table. In this tutorial, we set up a pipeline to ingest the complete historical or one-time data to the lakehouse.
- **Lakehouse:** In this lab, you create a lakehouse, ingest data into the files section of the lakehouse, and then create delta lake tables in the Tables section of the lakehouse.
- **Transform:** For data preparation and transformation, you see two different approaches. We demonstrate the use of Notebooks/Spark for users who prefer a code-first experience and use pipelines/dataflow for users who prefer a low-code or no-code experience.
- **Consume:** To demonstrate data consumption, you see how you can use the DirectLake feature of Power BI to create reports, and dashboards and directly query data from the lakehouse.
