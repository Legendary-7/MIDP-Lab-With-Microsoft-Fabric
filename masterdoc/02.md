# Lab 1: Analytics in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform	Lab

The lab showcases Analytics in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform. The Analytics solution pattern is a cost-effective, performance-optimized, and cloud-native architecture which helps our customers unify their data estate to accelerate data value creation. The visual here depicts the Microsoft Analytics Solution pattern. 

## Lab Objectives

**Exercise 1: Data ingestion from a spectrum of analytical and operational data sources into the Lakehouse.**
  - Task 1.1: Explore a Streaming data and analytics pipeline using ADX for a near real-time analytics scenario.

## Overview

The solution layers depicted here are as follows:

**1. Implementing a Lake First Data Foundation for Analytics**

Microsoft’s overall approach is based on an open and governed Data Lakehouse foundation for analytics. The open and governed Data Lakehouse foundation is a cost-effective and performance-optimized fabric for business intelligence, machine learning, and AI workloads at any scale. It is the foundation for migrating and modernizing existing analytics solutions, whether this be data appliances or traditional data warehouses. Finally, the Data Lakehouse is foundational for integrating data across a broad spectrum of emerging operational databases and systems including modern analytics applications.

**2. Implementing an Open and Governed Data Lakehouse**

With raw data landed in the data lake, the next step is to transform and prepare the data for analytics applications. We believe the best solution for data transformation and preparation is to anchor to an open and governed data Lakehouse. This provides a unified approach to serve the full spectrum of BI, ML, and AI applications. In the past, data lakes were used to serve data science applications, data warehouses, and data marts for BI applications. They relied on complex ETL pipelines to move data between, and across, the fabrics. Now, with the data Lakehouse foundation, we have a unified foundation to serve the most demanding BI, ML, and AI applications while also optimizing for performance and cost.

**3. Machine Learning and Data Analysis in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform**

**Machine Learning:** Data scientists can bring their preferred compute frameworks, languages, runtimes, and tools to the data Lakehouse to access data prepared for ML applications. In addition, they can further refine and enhance the data through feature engineering and additional statistical techniques. In most environments, experiments are performed iteratively to produce machine-learning models which provide the desired business outcomes.

**Data Analysis:** Ad-hoc and interactive data analysis using notebooks is a top-line workload and experience for data analysts. While data analysts can also use the Spark modalities generally used by data scientists, it is more common for data analysts to prefer SQL modalities. Up until recently, there was no clean solution to enable ad-hoc and interactive SQL data analysis directly on data in a data lake. With recent advances, we now have solutions to address this need with the following customer options in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform: 

- Synapse Serverless SQL notebooks 
- Azure Databricks SQL Analytics notebooks

**4. Business Intelligence in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform**

The Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform offers best-in-class integrated solutions to responsibly democratize business intelligence with self-serve tools and experiences for data analysts and data citizens.

**5. Data Governance in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform**

Microsoft Purview is the single-pane data governance solution in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform. Seamlessly integrate Purview with the Databricks catalog and metastore to enable a single-pane governance solution. Microsoft Purview provides a unified data governance experience that spans the MIDP analytics estate across Azure Data Lake, Synapse, Azure Databricks, Power BI, and Azure Machine Learning.

## Introduction

![Analytics in MIDP - Interactive Lab Experience](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Ignite-lab/blob/main/media/img_labexp.png?raw=true)

In this interactive demo/lab, you will experience an integrated, open, and governed Data Lakehouse foundation based on the Microsoft Analytics Solution pattern.  
We will cover the following:

**Exercise 1:** First, we will look at Data ingestion from a spectrum of analytical and operational data sources into the Lakehouse.
- We start with streaming data and analytics pipeline using ADX for a near real-time analytics scenario. 
- This will be followed by Synapse pipelines that ingest raw data from analytical/ operational data sources into the Bronze layer.
	   
**Exercise 2:** Second, we will explore offline data and analytics pipelines using open Delta format and Azure Databricks Delta Live Tables for data transformation.
- We will stitch streaming and non-streaming data (landed earlier), to create a combined data product to build a simple Lakehouse.  
	
**Exercise 3:** In the third step, we explore ML and BI scenarios on the Lakehouse. Here we will review the MLOps pipeline using the Azure Databricks managed MLFlow with Azure ML.
- Using Power BI with Synapse serverless capabilities we derive actionable insights.
- We will explore SQL Analytics with Azure Synapse Serverless and Azure Databricks.

**Exercise 4:** Finally, we will leverage Purview for data governance. 

## Let’s get started with the lab.
