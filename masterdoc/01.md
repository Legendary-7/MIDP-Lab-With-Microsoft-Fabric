# Analytics in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform Lab

## Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Overview

This interactive lab begins with exploring an integrated Data Lakehouse foundation, focusing on data ingestion, transformation, and analytics using ADX, Synapse, Azure Databricks, and Microsoft Purview. It includes exercises for creating pipelines, combining data, and investigating ML and BI scenarios. Involves working with Microsoft Fabric, including creating a workspace, building a lakehouse, ingesting sample data, preparing and transforming data, and developing reports. This segment emphasizes hands-on experience with data handling and reporting in a Microsoft Fabric environment.

## Objective

Understand how to unify data estates using the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform and manage a Data Lakehouse with Microsoft Fabric. This lab is arranged into two parts: the first part emphasizes building and leveraging Microsoft Fabric for advanced data analytics and reporting, while the second part focuses on implementing an integrated Data Lakehouse foundation. Learn data ingestion, transformation, and reporting for accelerated value creation. By the end of this lab, you will have comprehensive knowledge of these processes :

### 1. Analytics in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform Lab

- **Data ingestion from a spectrum of analytical and operational data sources into the Lakehouse** : Learn to implement data ingestion pipelines using ADX for streaming data and Synapse pipelines to ingest raw data from analytical and operational sources into the Bronze layer of the Data Lake.
- **Explore offline data and analytics pipeline using open Delta format and Azure Databricks Delta Live Tables. Stitch streaming and non-streaming data (landed earlier) to create a combined data product to build a simple Lakehouse** : Learn to use the open Delta format and Azure Databricks Delta Live Tables for offline data and analytics pipelines.
- **Explore Machine Learning and Business Intelligence scenarios on the Lakehouse** : Learn to explore ML and BI scenarios on the Lakehouse using Azure Databricks MLflow, Power BI, and SQL Analytics with Azure Synapse Serverless and Databricks.
- **Glimpse of Purview to govern the overall data and analytics estate** : Learn how the Purview governs the entire data and analytics estate, ensuring comprehensive data management and compliance

### 2. Lakehouse end-to-end scenario

- **Create a Fabric workspace** : Learn to create and set up a Fabric workspace, including understanding prerequisites and executing the workspace creation process.
- **Build a lakehouse** : Learn to build a lakehouse by activating SharePoint Online, creating the lakehouse, ingesting sample data, and building a report.
- **Ingest data into the lakehous** : Gain knowledge on ingesting data into the lakehouse, focusing on the efficient and effective methods for data integration. 
- **Prepare and transform data in the lakehouse** : Prepare and transform data within the lakehouse, focusing on data preparation techniques to ensure high-quality, actionable insights. This exercise covers essential practices for effective data transformation.
- **Building reports in Microsoft Fabric** : Create and build reports in Microsoft Fabric, focusing on leveraging the platform's capabilities to generate actionable insights. This exercise involves designing and developing comprehensive reports.

## Pre-requisites

- **Basic Understanding of Data Architecture**: Familiarity with data lakehouse and data warehouse concepts.
- **Microsoft Fabric Knowledge**: Basic knowledge of Microsoft Fabric and its components, including data integration, data engineering, and analytics services.

## Architecture

In this lab, the architecture covers two main aspects: first, it explores an integrated Data Lakehouse foundation using ADX, Synapse, and Azure Databricks for efficient data ingestion, transformation, and analytics, supporting ML and BI scenarios with governance by Microsoft Purview. Secondly, it delves into building and managing a unified data lakehouse with Microsoft Fabric, which includes creating a workspace, ingesting and preparing data, and leveraging Delta Lake for streamlined data processing and reporting through tools like Power BI.

- **Delta Lake** : Standardizes data storage with a unified format that supports reliable and scalable data processing across various analytics tools.
- **Lakehouse** : Combines the best features of data lakes and data warehouses, offering a unified data platform that supports both structured and unstructured data for comprehensive analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence.
- **Notebooks** : Provide an interactive environment for data exploration and analysis, allowing users to perform ad-hoc queries and visualize results using code or SQL.
- **Dataflows** : Enable the design and automation of data transformation processes within a visual interface, simplifying the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows.
- **Pipelines** : Orchestrate and automate data ingestion and processing tasks, integrating various data sources and ensuring smooth data movement through the analytics workflow.
- **Apache Spark** : Provides a powerful, distributed computing engine for large-scale data processing, supporting complex transformations and analytics with high performance and scalability

## Getting Started with Lab

**Note:** We recommend having strong internet connectivity while performing the lab. Please ensure you are not connected to a VPN as this can slow down the lab-user experience.

1. When the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will be loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine to perform the lab.
